# MyProgrammingPortfolio

This repository contains my C++ program developed for **Unit 5 – Emerging Trends in Programming**.  
The project demonstrates the use of **structures**, functions, user input, and conditional logic.

##  Project Title
Grade Calculator using Structure (C++)

##  Description
This program takes a student's:
- Name  
- Marks in 3 subjects  

It then:
1. Calculates the **average** of the marks  
2. Determines the **grade** using a function  
3. Displays the result  

The program uses a **structure (struct Student)** to store all student-related information such as name, marks, average, and grade.

## Concepts Used
- Structure in C++
- Functions
- Conditional statements (if–else)
- User input and output
- Basic arithmetic operations

##  Code Overview
- `struct Student` stores:
  - name  
  - marks of 3 subjects  
  - average  
  - grade  

- `calculateGrade()` function returns grade based on average:
  - A → avg ≥ 90  
  - B → avg ≥ 75  
  - C → avg ≥ 60  
  - D → avg ≥ 40  
  - F → below 40  

##  How to Run the Program
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the `.cpp` file in VS Code or Code::Blocks.
3. Compile the program using:
